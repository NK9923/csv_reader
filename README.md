# Simple C++ Project: General CSV-Reader with Dynamic Data Typing

This has been my first C++ project to start with, so there might be a lot of room for improvement. The project aims to create a straightforward and versatile CSV reader that eliminates the need for users to pre-specify data types for specific columns. The DLL leverages `std::optional` to handle potentially diverse data types, requiring C++17 for compatibility.

*Note: The project is currently halfway finished.*
